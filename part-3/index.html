  <h2>My trip to Peru - Part 3</h2>

<p>
  With the $90 Mom & Dad sent me, I was able to get a flight from Cali to Miami, with a stop in Panama. When
  the plane arrived in Miami (December 22), the customs officer took a quick look at me. My appearance may have aroused
  some suspicions. He carefully examined everything I brought with me, both in my backpack and in the flour sack that
  included goodies I acquired in Peru. I had no contraband; the socks I had were clearly not for resale. The officer
  reminded me a couple times that I could speak English there.
</p>
<p>
  I was 1900 miles from home. I had already been on a long road without much sleep. It was looking unlikely that
  afternoon that I would make it home for Christmas, but I decided to give it a shot and started hitchhiking. Most of my
  rides were pretty uneventful. A few stand out.
</p>
<p>

  <h3>7 & 7:</h3>

<p>
  One of my first rides was with a couple of guys in an old pickup. I threw my backpack and sack in the bed of the
  pickup and joined the good old boys in the cab. They let me sit in the middle. 
  I had seen "Deliverance" that summer, and
  was a bit concerned about Georgia backwoods folks.
</p>

<p>
  After chatting a bit about what I'd been doing, and what they were doing, the driver turned to his pal and said, "How
  'bout we take this'n off into the woods and rough'im up some?" Maybe they had seen the movie too. Clem didn't respond
  immediately. I wasn't in a squealing mood, so I said I wouldn't like that much. They didn't bring that idea up again,
  and they were headed a long way in my direction, so I just kept riding and smiling.
</p>
<p>
  After a while they pulled into a liquor store and got a fifth of Seagram's 7 whiskey and a can of Seven-Up. When we
  got back on the road, they were having 7 & 7's, passing the containers back and forth, taking a glug or two from the
  whiskey bottle and a sip of Seven-Up. I declined after a couple sips. 
</p>
<p>
The driver eventually decided he might be better
  off concentrating on his drinking. He asked if I could drive a stick shift. I had some experience in grandpa's '47
  Chevy and assured him I could. I thought we all might be better off if I concentrated on the driving. We pulled over
  and I switched into the driver's seat. My start was a bit jerky; they cursed me soundly and told me to pull over and
  get out. I barely had time to grab my backpack and sack before they roared off.
</p>

  <h3>The kindness of troopers:</h3>

  <p>
  By the time I got up into Indiana, I was really feeling the cold. The only cold weather gear I had was what I had
  bought in Peru - a poncho and a stocking cap. I put them on, with a clear plastic raincoat over the poncho to keep
  some of the wind out.

  About halfway through Indiana, a state trooper stopped and told me it was against the law to hitchhike on the
  interstate. He told me to get into his patrol car. We talked a bit and I told him I was trying to get home for
  Christmas. I figured he'd take me to the nearest jail or something, but I was too sleepy to care, not having slept
  since Colombia. When he woke me up, he told me to get out. I saw he had driven me to the Illinois line. I've had a
  soft spot for Indiana ever since.
</p>
<p>

  <h3>Tug what?:</h3>

<p>
  In Illinois I got a long ride from a man who said he was a tugboat captain on the Mississippi River. We chatted a
  while about various things, and he asked me if I'd ever had sex with a man. I told him I hadn't, and wasn't
  interested. I was a bit surprised, as such things were not so openly discussed back then. Again, I drifted off to
  sleep. I woke some time later to find his hand on my knee, and him urging me to take a look at his penis, sticking out
  of his trousers. I complimented him on his fine-looking penis, told him I still wasn't interested, and fell back to
  sleep until he dropped me off when he got to Iowa. I've had a soft spot for tugboats ever since.
</p>
<p>

  <h3>The kindness of parents:</h3>

<p>
  By the time I got to the truck stop by the intersection of I-80 and US-71, I was feeling pretty tired, having gone
  three days and two nights with no time in bed. It was getting dark that Christmas Eve - not the best time for
  hitchhiking. I called home collect and was very glad that Mom and Dad said they'd come get me when I called them. How
  far could it be? They could come straight down Highway 71! Turns out it was 180 miles, so I didn't get home until
  Christmas day, very tired but very happy to join the family gathered there.
</p>

  <h3>On to other adventures:</h3>

<p>
  I applied to the Peace Corps College Degree Program at Brockport, New York and found out they were teaching volunteers
  French and sending them to Zaire. That seemed at least as interesting as Peru, so I was quite happy when I got
  accepted.
