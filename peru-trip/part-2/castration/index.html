  <h3>About those castrations:</h3>
  <p>
    Dave and I rode a boat (powered by an outboard motor) to a ranch. I had exaggerated when I wrote in my
    letter that "he and I" castrated the calves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Actually, Dave and the rancher immobilized the calf while I stood off to the side.
    They used a castration process called "banding".

      Using a banding tool, Dave stretched a small rubber band <br> 
      until it was large enough to go around the calf's scrotum, <br>
      above the testicles. <br></figcaption>

  </figure>

  <p>
    I winced as each band was applied.
  </p>
  <p>
    With blood supply cut off, the scrotum and testicles atrophy and fall off within 20 to 40 days. Veterinarians say
    there is some pain initially, but numbness sets in quickly. I wonder how many veterinarians have personally tested
    that theory.
