  <h2>My trip to Peru - Part 2</h2>
  <p>
    I had a pleasant stay with Dave [17 days] after we finally got together in Puerto Bermudez.
  </p>

  <div class="letter-quote">
    <h3>Nov. 23 letter from Puerto Bermudez:</h3>
    <p>
      I found out when I got here that Dave expected to be in the middle of a vaccinating campaign against
      hoof-and-mouth disease and was going to be very busy.
      As it turned out, though, the vaccine didn’t arrive, so he didn’t have much to do. Indeed, the only cattle work
      he’s done the last two weeks was when he and I went out and <a href="castration">castrated a dozen
        calves</a>.
      Otherwise, “the living is easy” – we’ve been strolling around the village, talking over old times, new times, and
      future times. He played the guitar a lot, we both have read some – in general, a good vacation for both of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy Thanksgiving! [Nov. 23, in 1972] We’re hoping to fly out today or tomorrow in order to make it to Huancayo
      on Sat. where there is to be a big Thanksgiving dinner for and by the area's Peace Corps Volunteers and such
      visitors as may be around from the States. From there (since my visa in Peru expires Dec. 4), I plan to make a
      quick trip to the Incan ruins of Machu Picchu <a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a> , and then head home.
    </p>

    <h3>Dec. 4 letter from Huancayo</h3>
    <p>
      Well, Dave and I <a href="san-ramon">didn’t make it for the Thanksgiving dinner</a>, but we got some
      nice leftovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here's the main reason for the letter - almost inevitable from the Young Man Abroad: What I'd like is for you
      to take $90 [$640 in 2022 money] from my savings account (or make me a brief loan of that sum) and send it down
      to:<br />
      AMERICAN EXPRESS AGENCY<br />
      APARTADO AEREO No. 6725<br />
      CALI, COLOMBIA
    </p>
    <p>
      I have enough money to get back to Colombia, but I'd like to have money waiting there for my plane ticket to
      Miami. Send a certified check, or International Money Order, or whatever the bank recommends. A bank's certified
      check would probably be best.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Despite missing the Thanksgiving dinner, I must have liked Huancayo a lot, because I went to Lima,
    spent three days getting my visa extended, and returned to
    Huancayo. I remember very little of what happened in the 20 or so days I stayed there, probably because I was so
    high. <a href="#fn2" id="ref2">[2]</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    I do remember that I spent some time there with volunteers who had been through the Peace Corps College Degree
    program at the State University of New York in Brockport. They were from Brockport groups 4 and 5. They were teaching in schools in and around Huancayo. They told
    me that, in Brockport, they:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>studied straight through four semesters in fifteen months,</li>
    <li>learned enough Spanish and educational skills to teach high school students,</li>
    <li>completed their college degree, and</li>
    <li>left to start a two-year tour as Peace Corps volunteers, with a teaching job and a living allowance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    That seemed like something I'd like to do.
  </p>

  <h3>Heading north:</h3>
  <p>
    I sent another letter on Dec. 5, with the same request for additional funds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe I didn't head out until 13 days after those letters to allow time for:
    at least one of the letters to get to Windom,
    Mom and Dad to send the money, and
    the money to get to Colombia.</p>
  <p>
    While I waited, I bought a few handmade items to take home, including a poncho and a knit cap with ear flaps and
    tassels. The items
    didn't fit in my backpack, so I put them in a flour sack that I got down there and sewed it shut for security.
  </p>
  <p>Once I got on the road, I did not dawdle - just four days on several buses to travel what Google Maps
    estimates would now take 44 hours in a car.
  </p>

  <h3>Sock Smuggling:</h3>
  <p>
    Socks were cheaper in Peru than in Ecuador. Before the bus got to the border, one of the passengers asked me,
    "Please put these socks in your backpack. They won't check your bags." Being (at that time) an adventurous sort, I
    said, "Sure! Why not?"
  </p>
  <p>
    After we got into Ecuador, customs officers got on the bus at each checkpoint,
    and checked luggage for contraband. I held my breath as the officers checked bags, women wailed when their socks
    were confiscated,
    and men gnashed their teeth as they passed a little money to an officer. No one checked my bags, so my new friend's
    contraband socks made it through. I was not offered a courier's fee, nor did I request one. I was happy to do my
    little bit to keep Ecuadoran sock prices down.
  </p>

  <h3>Almost home:</h3>
  <p>
    My next phase was to fly to Miami and get back to Windom.

    <li id="fn1">The "quick trip" to Machu Picchu that I mentioned in the Nov. 23 letter didn't happen until 2016, when
      I went with
      Mickey and my sister Deb. It was more fun that way than it would have been all alone.<a href="#ref1">↩</a></li>
