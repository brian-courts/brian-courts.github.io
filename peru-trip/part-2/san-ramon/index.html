    <h3>Flying out for Thanksgiving:</h3>

    <p>
        On Nov. 24, Dave and I tried to fly out to San Ramon on an air-taxi. When we got on the plane, I was
        surprised to be sitting on large pieces of cow, with just a layer of cardboard between me and the hunks of
        quivering
        flesh. Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised. Beef was one of the main cargo items out of that agricultural
        area.

        The day was pretty cloudy, and when we thought we were getting close to the destination, the pilot slowly
        descended
        between mountains, trying to get below the clouds. We were all intently scanning below, trying to find the
        airport.

        I happened to look up, saw we were about to crash into a mountain, frantically tapped the pilot on the shoulder,
        and
        pointed toward the mountain. He made a hard turn, avoided the mountain and decided to head back. We were not
        charged
        for that round trip flight and managed to get out OK the next clear day, on those still-quivering hunks of
        flesh.
