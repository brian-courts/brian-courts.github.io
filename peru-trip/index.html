    <h2>My Trip to Peru</h2>

    <p>
        In 1972, I went from my home town in Windom, Minnesota to visit my friend Dave Morfitt in Peru because I was
        tired
        of boring jobs and wanted to see some of the world.
        If I had not taken that trip, it is very unlikely that I would have gone to Brockport, met the love of my life,
        or
        had the later adventures and quiet times that brought me much pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
        This illustrated narrative documents that trip. If you have any comments, please
        send me an email at bc.pub19-peru@yahoo.com
